# Bevy Cobweb UI

**This crate is under development.**

Provides a reactivity layer on top of `sickle_ui` using `bevy_cobweb`, with an optional asset-based workflow for building UI.


todo: Make it clear that built-in widgets are automatically loaded and ready to go when the `widgets` feature is enabled.
- Built-in widget styling should not be considered stable at this time.
