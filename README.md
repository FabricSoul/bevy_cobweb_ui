# Bevy Cobweb UI

**This crate is under development.**

Tools and widgets for building UI with `bevy_cobweb`.

This crate makes building code-driven game UI as simple and easy as possible, targeting small-to-medium-scale UI projects. It also allows UI layout/configuration to be specified in asset files (TODO), which can be hot-reloaded or edited from a UI editor to support efficient fine-tuning in live apps.
